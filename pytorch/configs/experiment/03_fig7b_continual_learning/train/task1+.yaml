trainer:
  # Set to 10000 because we train a new model initialized from previous task,
  # which starts from the epoch left off in previous task, and have 77 tasks total.
  # Note: Models don't actually train for this long as early stopping kicks in;
  # this high value just ensures we can train all models without stopping due to low max_epoch
