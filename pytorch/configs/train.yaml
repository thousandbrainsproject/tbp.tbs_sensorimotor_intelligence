# specify here default configuration
# order of defaults determines the order in which configs override each other
defaults:
  - _self_
  - data: ycb_standard
  - model: vit
  - callbacks: default
  - logger: wandb # set logger here or use command line (e.g. `python train.py logger=tensorboard`)
  - trainer: default
  - paths: default
  - extras: default
  - hydra: default

  # experiment configs allow for version control of specific hyperparameters
  # e.g. best hyperparameters for given model and datamodule
  - experiment: null

# task name, determines output directory path
task_name: "train"

# tags to help you identify your experiments
# you can overwrite this in experiment configs
# overwrite from command line with `python train.py tags="[first_tag, second_tag]"`
tags: ["dev"]

# set False to skip model training
train: True

# evaluate on test set, using best model weights achieved during training
# lightning chooses best weights based on the metric specified in checkpoint callback
test: True

# simply provide checkpoint path to resume training
ckpt_path: null

# seed for random number generators in pytorch, numpy and python.random
seed: null
